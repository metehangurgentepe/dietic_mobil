# Dietic Mobile 

Dietic is mobile application for dietitian and patients. Dietic facilitates the connection between a dietitian and their clients. The dietitian can view the diet plans they create for their clients, check the calorie content of any meal from the food database, schedule appointments, and communicate with their clients via messaging. In this way, it ensures the satisfaction of the clients. The clients, on the other hand, can access their diet plans, schedule appointments, check the calorie content of desired meals from the food database, and communicate with their dietitian.
